    entries: [
      ['What format is the output?',
       <span>
         The output is formatted to be used with <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">BibLaTeX</a>. BibLaTeX is a more modern approach to bibliography than LaTeX's default bibliography support and has many advantages over it. In particular, its database format is well-defined, as opposed to the default format, where a field can have different meanings depending on the chosen style (the <code>.bst</code> file that you choose with <code>\bibliographystyle</code>). It is able to accurately represent an arXiv entry, while the default styles cannot.

      ['What is the difference between BibLaTeX, natbib, Biber, BibTeX...?',
       <span>BibLaTeX is a LaTeX package used to format bibliography. Its ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù counterpart was the <code>\bibliography</code> / <code>\printbibliography</code> in standard LaTeX, the <code>thebibliography</code> environment, or packages such as <code>natbib</code>.
         <br />
       BibTeX and Biber are two external programs that convert a <code>.bib</code> file into a <code>.bbl</code> file readable by LaTeX. One of the main advantages of Biber over BibTeX is its support of Unicode characters. <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/25701/14965">Read more about this on TeX.SE.</a></span>],
      ['But I want to use the usual bibliography package!',
       <span>I plan to add support for it in the future. In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/nidrissi/arxiv2bib">feel free to contribute</a> üòÉ. But be aware that unlike BibLaTeX, the style you choose for your article will influence greatly the required format for the bibliography entry.</span>],
