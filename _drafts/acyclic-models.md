The theorem(s) of acyclic models are a rather powerful technique for proving that some functors defined on truncated chain complexes can be extended in higher dimensions, and that two such functors are homotopic, by proving it on a small class of "model" objects.

For some reason I only discovered this last year, and I always find myself forgetting the precise hypotheses and conclusion... Hopefully writing this blog post will fix them in my mind. My main reference will be:

## The theorem

### "Representable" functors

Let $$\mathsf{C}$$ be any category (for example topological spaces, simplicial set...). Let also $$\mathcal{M} \subset \operatorname{ob} \mathsf{C}$$ be a *set* of objects, called **model objects**.

For a functor $$T : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ab}$$ to the category of abelian groups, let $$\widetilde{T} : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ab}$$ be the new functor defined as follows:

* for an object $$A$$, $$\widetilde{T}(A)$$ is the free abelian group generated by the set of pairs $$(M, \varphi, m)$$, where $$M \in \mathcal{M}$$, $$\varphi : M \to A$$ is a morphism, and $$m \in T(M)$$;
* for a morphism $$\alpha : A \to B$$, $$\widetilde{T}(\alpha)$$ maps $$(M, \varphi, m)$$ to $$(M, \alpha \circ \varphi, m)$$.

There is also a natural transformation $$\Phi : \widetilde{T} \to T$$ given by $$\Phi_A(M, \varphi, m) = T(\varphi)(m)$$. Morally, this is similar to the construction where you take an abelian group and you want to view it as a quotient of a free object: you take the free abelian group generated by all elements of your group, and you quotient by the relation $$g \cdot g' \equiv gg'$$. Here we want to view all the $$T(A)$$ as generated by the $$T(M)$$.

The functor $$T$$ is then said to be **representable** (the terminology is unfortunate...) if $$\Phi$$ has a right inverse, i.e. there is a natural transformation $$\Psi :  T \to \widetilde{T}$$ such that $$\Phi\Psi$$ is the identity of $$T$$.

In other words, this means that for all $$A \in \mathsf{C}$$, $$T(A)$$ has a "basis" (consisting of models objects) which is described by $$\Psi$$: $$\Psi_A : T(A) \to \widetilde{T}(A)$$ sends $$x \in T(A)$$ to a sum $$\sum_{\alpha} (M_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha, m_\alpha)$$ such that

$$x = \sum_\alpha T(\varphi_\alpha)(m_\alpha).$$

When a functor is representable, we will be able to check equalities on $$\mathcal{M}$$, and equalities on $$\mathsf{C}$$ will follow.
