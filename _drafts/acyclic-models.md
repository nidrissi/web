The theorem(s) of acyclic models are a rather powerful technique for proving that some functors defined on truncated chain complexes can be extended in higher dimensions, and that two such functors are homotopic, by proving it on a small class of "model" objects.

For some reason I only discovered this last year, and I always find myself forgetting the precise hypotheses and conclusion... Hopefully writing this blog post will fix them in my mind. My main reference will be:

* Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane. "Acyclic models". In: *Amer. J. Math.* 75 (1953), pp. 189–199. ISSN: 0002-9327. JSTOR: [2372628](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2372628). [MR0052766](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0052766).

Unless indicated otherwise, all the definitions, theorems... come from there.

## The theorem

### "Representable" functors

Let $$\mathsf{C}$$ be any category (for example topological spaces, simplicial set...). Let also $$\mathcal{M} \subset \operatorname{ob} \mathsf{C}$$ be a *set* of objects, called (acyclic) **model objects** (think about standard simplexes).

For a functor $$T : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ab}$$ to the category of abelian groups, let $$\widetilde{T} : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ab}$$ be the new functor defined as follows:

* for an object $$A$$, $$\widetilde{T}(A)$$ is the free abelian group generated by the set of pairs $$(M, \varphi, m)$$, where $$M \in \mathcal{M}$$, $$\varphi : M \to A$$ is a morphism, and $$m \in T(M)$$;
* for a morphism $$\alpha : A \to B$$, $$\widetilde{T}(\alpha)$$ maps $$(M, \varphi, m)$$ to $$(M, \alpha \circ \varphi, m)$$.

There is also a natural transformation $$\Phi : \widetilde{T} \to T$$ given by $$\Phi_A(M, \varphi, m) = T(\varphi)(m)$$. Morally, this is similar to the construction where you take an abelian group and you want to view it as a quotient of a free object: you take the free abelian group generated by all elements of your group, and you quotient by the relation $$g \cdot g' \equiv gg'$$. Here we want to view all the $$T(A)$$ as generated by the $$T(M)$$.

The functor $$T$$ is then said to be **representable** (the terminology is unfortunate...) if $$\Phi$$ has a right inverse, i.e. there is a natural transformation $$\Psi :  T \to \widetilde{T}$$ such that $$\Phi\Psi$$ is the identity of $$T$$.

In other words, this means that for all $$A \in \mathsf{C}$$, $$T(A)$$ has a "basis" (consisting of models objects) which is described by $$\Psi$$: $$\Psi_A : T(A) \to \widetilde{T}(A)$$ sends $$x \in T(A)$$ to a sum $$\sum_{\alpha} (M_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha, m_\alpha)$$ such that

$$x = \sum_\alpha T(\varphi_\alpha)(m_\alpha).$$

When a functor is representable, we will be able to check equalities on $$\mathcal{M}$$, and equalities on $$\mathsf{C}$$ will follow.

### Chain complexes

Now suppose we are given a functor $$K : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ch}$$ from our category $$\mathsf{C}$$ to the category of nonnegatively graded chain complexes. We will denote $$\partial_q : K_q(A) \to K_{q-1}(A)$$ the differential.

If $$K$$ and $$L$$ are two such functors, then we can define maps $$K \to L$$ in the obvious way, and we can also define truncated maps in degrees $$\le n$$. Similarly given two maps, we can define homotopies between then, as well as truncated homotopies, which satisfy

$$\partial_{q+1} h_q + h_{q-1} \partial_q = g_q - f_q$$

in degrees $$\le n$$.

**Theorem.** Let $$K,L : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ch}$$ be two functors and $$f : K \to L$$ be a map truncated in degrees $$< q$$. If $$K_q$$ is representable and $$H_{q-1}(L(M)) = 0$$ for all $$M \in \mathcal{M}$$, then $$f$$ can be extended in dimension $$q$$.

*Proof.* We want to define $$f_q : K_q \to L_q$$ such that $$\partial_q f_q f_{q-1} \partial_{q-1}$$. For all models $$M$$ and all $$m \in K_q(M)$$, the element $$f_{q-1}(\partial_q m)$$ is a cycle in $$L_{q-1}(M)$$; but $$L_{q-1}(M)$$ is acyclic, thus we can choose some $$\lambda(m) \in L_q(M)$$ such that $$\partial_q \lambda(m) = f_{q-1} \partial_q m$$.

Now we let $$\Lambda : \widetilde{K_q} \to L_q$$ be defined by

$$\Lambda_A(M, \varphi, m) := L_q(\varphi)(\lambda(m)).$$

It's easy to check that this is a natural transformation, and that $$\partial_q \Lambda = f_{q-1} \partial_q \Phi$$ (where $$\Phi : \widetilde{K_q} \to K_q$$ is the canonical morphism).

But since $$K_q$$ was representable, we can let $$f_q = \Lambda \Psi$$ where $$\Psi$$ is the right inverse to $$\Phi$$, and everything works out. ■

Do you see what we did (well, Eilenberg--MacLane did) here? It was easy to define an "$$f_q$$-like" map on the free stuff generated by the models, because we could just choose an arbitrary lift for each element without bothering to check if they were compatible with each other. The "representability" of $$K_q$$ then provides a way to combine these all together. (This is also why we needed $$\mathcal{M}$$ to be a set -- I don't think it would have been possible to "choose" these lifts if it were a proper class...).

The proof of the following theorem is almost the same (exercise!).

**Theorem.** Let $$K,L : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ch}$$ be two functors, $$f,g : K \to L$$ two maps and $$h : f \simeq g$$ a homotopy truncated in degrees $$< q$$. If $$K_q$$ is representable and $$H_q(L(M)) = 0$$ for all $$M \in \mathcal{M}$$, then $$h$$ can be extended in dimension $$q$$.

These two theorems combine to give:

**Theorem.** Let $$K,L : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ch}$$ be two functors, and $$f : K \to L$$ be a map truncated in degrees $$< q$$. If $$K_n$$ is representable for all $$n \ge q$$ and $$H_n(L(M)) = 0$$ for all models and for all $$n \ge q - 1$$, then $$f$$ admits a unique (up to homotopy) extension in all degrees.

## Example: action of a monoid on a group

Let $$W$$ be a monoid and $$\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}[W]$$ be its algebra. We may view $$W$$ as a category $$\mathsf{C}$$ with a unique object and $$\hom_{\mathsf{C}}(*,*) = W$$. We set $$\mathcal{M} = \operatorname{ob} \mathsf{C} = \{*\}$$.

A functor $$T : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Ab}$$ is the same thing as a group equipped with a left action of $$W$$, i.e. a left $$\Lambda$$-module ; the functor $$\tilde{T}$$ is the free abelian group on the set of pairs $$W \times G$$, with $$W$$ acting as $$w \cdot (w',g) := (ww', g)$$. In other words, it's the free $$\Lambda$$-module on $$G$$. The functor $$T$$ is then representable iff $$G$$ is projective as a $$\Lambda$$-module.
