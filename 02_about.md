Hi! My name is Najib Idrissi. I'm a PhD student at [Université Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr) in mathematics, at the [Laboratoire Paul Painlevé](http://math.univ-lille1.fr). My advisor is [Benoit Fresse](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse). Before that I was a student at the [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr), and my current PhD contract is funded by them. You can contact me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

I'm mainly interested in [operads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory) and their applications to algebraic topology, homological algebra and quantum field theory. My main goal right now is to exploit the formality of the $E_n$-operads to try and compute explicitly [factorization homology](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/factorization+homology) in some cases.

I also have a [webpage hosted by my lab](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~idrissi), where you can find information about my research, my CV, more contact information...

I use [Math.StackExchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/10014/najib-idrissi) often, and I'm also on [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/users/36146/najib-idrissi).
