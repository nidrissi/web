Hello! I am Najib <abbr title="My complete family name is ‘Idrissi Kaïtouni’ and it is possible to find it in some places. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions – for example, automated systems thinking that ‘Idrissi’ is my middle name and that I should be called ‘NI Kaïtouni’...).">Idrissi</abbr>, and I am a mathematician.
I am mainly interested in operads and their applications to algebraic topology, more specifically the study of configuration spaces and their links to graph complexes.

I am a *maître de conférences* at [Paris Diderot University](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr).
I am part of the team-project [Algebraic Topology & Geometry](https://www.imj-prg.fr/tga/) of the [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu--Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr), and I am one of the organizers of its [Topology Seminar](https://www.imj-prg.fr/spip.php?article67).

Between February and August 2018, I was postdoc at [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/).
In November 2017, I defended [my doctoral thesis]({{< ref "/research/thesis/index.en.md" >}}) under the direction of [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/) at the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr).
You can find more info in [my CV]({{< ref "/cv/index.en.md" >}}).

I am active on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/36146/najib-idrissi) and [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/10014/najib-idrissi).
