I have written a tool which I called [arXiv2BibLaTeX](/misc/a2b) to produce BibLaTeX entries from arXiv preprints.
It is of course open source: the code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/nidrissi/nidrissi/tree/master/src/a2b).

From January to June 2019, I organized a [reading seminar on homological stability and the works of Galatius--Kupers--Randal-Williams](/misc/stabilite) with Mario Gonçalves Lamas following an idea of Muriel Livernet.
