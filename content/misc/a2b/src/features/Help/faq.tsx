            There are several programs around for making a Bib(La)Tex entry out
            of an arXiv entry. However, all the ones I found have issues: URLs
            are displayed twice, author names are not handled correctly (see

                ArXiv is not very diligent when it comes to updating their TeX

                </a>{" "}
                and as such their distribution contains BibLaTeX v3.7, which is
                found in the historic archives of TeX Live 2017. The current
                version of BibLaTeX is v3.15a (in September 2020).

                to compile <code>.bib</code> files with Biber or BibTeX. They
                require authors to send their compiled <code>.bbl</code> file.
                Unfortunately, files compiled for a newer version of BibLaTeX
                are not compatible with old versions. BibTeX has not been
                updated for decades so this is not an issue, but BibLaTeX is
                under active development.
              </li>

            There are several ways to solve this,{" "}

              as explained in the BibLaTeX development wiki

            . The simplest one, in my opinion, is to install TeX Live 2017 from

      {
        myKey: "surnames",
        q: "How does the program handle surnames?",
        a: (
          <>
            ArXiv stores author names as e.g. “Jane H. Doe.” However, BibLaTeX
            expects surnames to be separated from given names, e.g. “Doe, Jane
            H.” This allows it to make special formatting of names, for example
            by automatically abbreviating given names (“J. H. Doe”) or
            capitalizing surnames in some styles (e.g. in French: “Jane H.
            Dᴏᴇ”).
            <br />
            To deal with this, I made a very simple and sometimes wrong
            assumption: the last word in a name is the surname, everything else
            is the given name. I am aware that this fails in a few cases, for
            example:
            <ul className="mb-0">
              <li>
                when people have two or more surname, e.g. my own full name,
                “Najib Idrissi Kaïtouni”... or for example in many Spanish
                names;
              </li>
              <li>
                when there is an addendum such as “John Doe, <em>Jr.</em>",
                “Jean <em>de la</em> Fontaine” or “Vincent <em>van</em> Gogh.”
              </li>
            </ul>
            Due to the large number of possible variations, it is not possible
            to automatically deal with this issue and it must be fixed by hand
            every time. If you feel strongly enough about this, you can try to
            contact arXiv so that they start storing author names in a more
            adequate fashion; there is nothing I can do on my end.

            they must <em>not</em> follow it (e.g. in French titles must look
