abstract: We study bicolored configurations of points in the Euclidean \\(n\\)-space that are constrained to remain either inside or outside a fixed Euclidean \\(m\\)-subspace, with \\(n - m \ge 2\\). We define a higher-codimensional variant of the Swiss-Cheese operad, called the complementarily constrained disks operad \\(\mathsf{CD}_{mn}\\), associated to such configurations. The operad \\(\mathsf{CD}_mn\\) is weakly equivalent to the operad of locally constant factorization algebras on the stratified space \\(\{\mathbb{R}^{m} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}\}\\). We prove that this operad is formal over \\(\mathbb{R}\\).
