abstract = "We study configurations of points in the complement of a linear subspace inside a Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ with $n - m \\ge 2$. We define a higher-codimensional Swiss-Cheese operad $\\mathsf{VSC}\\_{mn}$ associated to such configurations, a variant of the classical Swiss-Cheese operad. The operad $\\mathsf{VSC}\\_{mn}$ is weakly equivalent to the operad of locally constant factorization algebras on the stratified space $\\{\\mathbb{R}^{m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\}$. We prove that this operad is formal over $\\mathbb{R}$."
