abstract = "We study configuration spaces of framed points on compact manifolds. Such configuration spaces admit natural actions of the framed little discs operads, that play an important role in the study of embedding spaces of manifolds and in factorization homology. We construct real combinatorial models for these operadic modules, for compact smooth manifolds without boundary."
