Factorization homology is a homology theory for structured manifolds (e.g. oriented or parallelized) which finds its roots in topological and conformal field theory (cf. Beilinson--Drinfeld, Salvatore, Lurie, Ayala--Francis, Costello--Gwilliam among others). After defining factorization homology, I will explain how to compute it for simply connected closed manifolds over the real numbers using the Lambrechts--Stanley model of configuration spaces.
