abstract = "We study the real homotopy type of configuration spaces of smooth compact manifolds with and without boundary. We provide an explicit real model of these configuration spaces for closed manifolds and a large class of manifolds with boundary, and we show that it only depends on the real homotopy type of the manifold. We moreover study the action of the little disks operads and the Swiss-cheese operads on the configuration spaces of framed manifolds, and we prove that our model is compatible with them."
