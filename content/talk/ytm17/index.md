abstract: We prove a conjecture of Lambrechts and Stanley about the homotopy invariance and the definition of models for configuration spaces of (smooth) simply connected manifolds over $\\mathbb{R}$. We do this using ideas coming from Kontsevich's proof of the formality of the little disks operads.
