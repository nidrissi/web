title: Curved Koszul duality and factorization homology
date: 2018-06-20
TBA: false
draft: false
abstract: "Koszul duality is a powerful tool that can be used to produce resolutions of algebras in many contexts. In this talk, I explain how to use curved Koszul duality for algebras over unital operads to compute the factorization homology of a closed manifold with values in the algebra of polynomial functions on a standard shifted symplectic space."
