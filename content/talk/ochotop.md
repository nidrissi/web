Configuration spaces consist in ordered collections of pairwise disjoint points. The collection of all configuration spaces of a given manifold has the structure of a right module over some version of the little disks operad. In this talk, I will present algebraic models for the real or rational homotopy types configuration spaces and framed configuration spaces of manifolds as right modules. The proofs all rely on operad theory, more precisely Kontsevich's proof of the formality of the little disks operad and - for oriented surfaces - Tamarkin's proof of the formality of the little 2-disks operad. (Based on joint works with Campos, Ducoulombier, Lambrechts, and Willwacher.)
