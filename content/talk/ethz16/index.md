abstract: 'Voronov''s "Swiss-Cheese" operad governs the action of a little disks algebra on a little intervals algebra. In this talk, I will explain how to obtain models of the fundamental groupoid of the Swiss-Cheese operad: a first model using bicolored braids and whose algebras can be described using Drinfeld centers, and a second (rational) model that involves a Drinfeld associator. We will compare this model to the model deduced from the homology of the Swiss-Cheese operad, the difference being explained by the non-formality of SC.'
