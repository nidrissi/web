# Hello!

I am Najib <abbr title="My complete family name is ‘Idrissi Kaïtouni’ and it's possible to find it in some places, e.g. in my email address. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions – for example, automated systems thinking that ‘Idrissi’ is my middle name and that I should be called ‘NI Kaïtouni’...).">Idrissi</abbr>, and I am a mathematician.
I defended [my PhD](/publication/thesis/) (under the direction of [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse)) on November 17th, and I will begin a postdoc at [{{< logo "ethz.png" "ETH" >}} ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/) in February.

You can find [my CV in English here]({{< ref "cv.md" >}}).
