# Hello!

I am Najib <abbr title="My complete family name is ‘Idrissi Kaïtouni’ and it's possible to find it in some places. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions – for example, automated systems thinking that ‘Idrissi’ is my middle name and that I should be called ‘NI Kaïtouni’...).">Idrissi</abbr>, and I do math for a living.
I am mainly interested in operads and their applications to algebraic topology, more specifically the study fo configuration spaces and their links to graph complexes.

I was a student of the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.fr) from 2011 to 2015, then [I completed my PhD]({{< relref "research/thesis.md" >}}) in November 2017 under the direction of [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse) at [Université Lille 1](https://www.univ-lille.fr).
I am now a postdoc at [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/), since February 2018.

You can find [my CV in English here]({{< relref "cv.md" >}}).
