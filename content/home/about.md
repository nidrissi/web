# Hello!

I am Najib Idrissi
<a href="#" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-placement="right" data-content="My complete family name is 'Idrissi Kaïtouni' and it's possible to find this name in some places, e.g. in my email address. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions (for example, automated systems thinking that 'Idrissi' is my middle name and that I should be called 'NI Kaïtouni' -- this already happened!)."><small><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span></small></a>,
a PhD student in mathematics at the [laboratoire Paul Painlevé](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/) of [Université Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/) (since September 2015). My advisor is [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/), and my contract is funded by the [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr).

My main interests are operads (and in particular little disks operads), and their applications to algebraic topology, TQFTs...

You can find [my CV here](/files/cv_idrissi_en.pdf) (and also [*en français*](/files/cv_idrissi_fr.pdf)).
