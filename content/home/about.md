# Hello!

I am Najib <abbr title="My complete family name is ‘Idrissi Kaïtouni’ and it's possible to find it in some places. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions – for example, automated systems thinking that ‘Idrissi’ is my middle name and that I should be called ‘NI Kaïtouni’...).">Idrissi</abbr>, and I do math for a living.
I defended [my PhD]({{< ref "research/thesis.md" >}}) (under the direction of [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse)) on November 17th, and I am now a postdoc at [{{< logo "ethz.png" "ETH" >}} ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/)

You can find [my CV in English here]({{< ref "cv.md" >}}).
