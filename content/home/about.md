# Hello!

I'm Najib Idrissi, a PhD student in mathematics at the [laboratoire Paul Painlevé](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/) of [Université Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/) (since September 2015). My advisor is [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/), and my contract is funded by the [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr).

You can find [my CV here](/files/cv_idrissi_en.pdf) (and also [*en français*](/files/cv_idrissi_fr.pdf)).

<small>My complete family name is “Idrissi Kaïtouni” and it's possible to find this name in some places (e.g. in my email address); that's still me. I prefer to use only “Idrissi” in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions.</small>
