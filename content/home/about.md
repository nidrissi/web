# Hello!

I am Najib Idrissi<sup><a href="#" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-placement="right" data-content="My complete family name is 'Idrissi Kaïtouni' and it's possible to find this name in some places, e.g. in my email address. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions (for example, automated systems thinking that 'Idrissi' is my middle name and that I should be called 'NI Kaïtouni' -- this already happened!)."><small><span class="fa fa-question-circle"></span></small></a></sup>,
a PhD student in mathematics at the
[{{< logo "labo.png" >}} Laboratoire Paul Painlevé](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/)
of
[{{< logo "univ.png" >}} Université Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/) (since September 2015). My advisor is [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/), and my contract is funded by the
[{{< logo "ens.jpg" >}} École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr).
I defended my PhD on November 17th, and I will begin a postdoc at [{{< logo "ethz.png" >}} ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) with [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/) in February.

My main interests are operads, and their applications to algebraic topology, TQFTs... The subject of my PhD thesis is the study of the homotopy type of configuration spaces exploiting the formality of the little disks operads.

You can find [my CV in English here](/cv/en/) ([*aussi disponible en français*](/cv/fr/)).
