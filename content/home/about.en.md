# Hello!

I am Najib <abbr title="My complete family name is ‘Idrissi Kaïtouni’ and it's possible to find it in some places. I prefer to use only 'Idrissi' in academic settings for simplicity and to avoid some confusions – for example, automated systems thinking that ‘Idrissi’ is my middle name and that I should be called ‘NI Kaïtouni’...).">Idrissi</abbr>, and I am a mathematician.
I am mainly interested in operads and their applications to algebraic topology, more specifically the study of configuration spaces and their links to graph complexes.

Starting in September, I will be *maître de conférences* at [Paris Diderot University (Paris 7)](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr) (= permanent rank B faculty).
I will be affiliated to the team-project [Algebraic Topology & Geometry](https://www.imj-prg.fr/tga/) of the [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu--Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr).

*As I do not know when my `@ethz.ch` address will be deactivated, please contact me using the email address `@imj-prg.fr` written here, to avoid later problems.*
 
I am currently a postdoc at [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Thomas Willwacher](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~wilthoma/).
I completed [my PhD]({{< ref "/research/thesis.en.md" >}}) under the direction of [Benoit Fresse](https://math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/) at the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr) in November 2017.
Before that, I was student of the [ENS Paris](https://www.ens.fr).
You can find more info in [my CV]({{< ref "/cv.en.md" >}}).

I am a member of the [SMF](http://smf.emath.fr/) and the [EMS](http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/).
I also write [reviews for zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/?q=rv%3Anajib%2Bidrissi).
