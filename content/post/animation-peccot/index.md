I am finishing to prepare my [Peccot Lectures](/class/peccot) that start next week.
I have prepared a small animation to illustrate the Fulton--MacPherson compactification using Blender, and I think it's relatively neat!
I am not a 3D artist, obviously, but (with oral explanations) I think it explains the concept better than drawing on the board, since drawing moving 3D pictures is not an easy task...
[The animation is available here](animation.mp4), and here it is in all its glory:
