title: List of Facts
---

I just started a [list of facts]({{< ref "/facts.en.md" >}}), mainly rather classical facts that I don't want to forget. Before, that list lived on sheets of papers strewn across my desk, which was clearly not optimal. Now it's in a more permanent form.

*Update:* I haven't updated this list yet to the new blog format, so the link above is broken...

*Update 2:* It now works.
