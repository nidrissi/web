My second paper, [The Lambrechts--Stanley Model of Configuration Space]({{< ref "/research/conf-spaces.en.md" >}}), has been accepted for publication in *Inventiones Mathematicae*!
This is a great honor and I am very happy.
The refeereing process was a bit above average (14 months for the first report, 7 for the final acceptancee), but I am thankful for it.
The anonymous referee had many remarks and questions that greatly improved my paper.
Most of the comments were about the presentation of the paper, and thanks to the referee's suggestions, I believe it has been improved quite a bit.
Since I use techniques from several areas of mathematics -- algebraic topology, differential geometry, mathematical physics, and of course operad theory -- these suggestions helped make the paper more accessible (hopefully) to a broader audience.
So, I'd like to thank the referee, as well as many people (see the acknowledgments on my paper): Ricardo Campos, Ivo Dell'Ambrogio, Julien Ducoulombier, Matteo Felder, Benoit Fresse, Ben Knudsen, Pascal Lambrechts, Antoine TouzÃ©, Thomas Willwacher.
Anyway, time to celebrate! 
(And tomorrow's my birthday! ðŸ˜ƒ)
