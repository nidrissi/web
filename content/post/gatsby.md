title: New website!

You may have noticed that the layout of my website has almost completely changed.
I have completely reworked the way it's rendered!
Instead of Hugo, I am now using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a JavaScript framework for producing static websites.
I have had this project for a while, but never took the time to do it.
Given the circumstances (COVID...), I have a lot more "free time" than usual and managed to do it---essentially---over the week-end.
You can check out [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/nidrissi/nidrissi) for the source.

Not all the kinks have been working out.
In particular, all the URLs have changed, and the website is now monolingual.
I'm planning on reintroducing the French version of the website in the near future.
In the meantime, [feel free to tell me about any issue with the website 🙂](https://github.com/nidrissi/nidrissi/issues).
