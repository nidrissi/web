I have finished translation my notes for my [Peccot Lecture]({{< ref "class/peccot" >}}) to English.
They have also been expanded, with a lot more new content.
For the time being, you can [find the notes here]({{< ref "research/peccot" >}}).
They have been submitted for publication.
I would like to thank again all the people who supported me (see the PDF file for names 😉).
