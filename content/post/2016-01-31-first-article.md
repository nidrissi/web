My first article has been accepted for publication with minor revisions! Entitled "Opérades et structures commutatives à homotopie près" (yes, it's in French), it will appear in the *Graduate Student Mathematical Diary*, edited by the [Mediterranean Institute For The Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mims.tn/). The article is expository in nature, it contains a general introduction to the theory of operads, and then some applications of the theory, mostly in relation with the little disks operads. I'm psyched!

Now let's hope that my preprint [Swiss-Cheese operad and Drinfeld center](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06844) meets the same fate... ☺
