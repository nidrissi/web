Yesterday I received a letter from the CollÃ¨ge de France.
I have been selected to give this year a [Peccot Lecture](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/cours-peccot/index.htm), which "<abbr title="Translated from French by myself.">rewards each year young mathematicians under 30 who have been noticed in theoretical or applied mathematics</abbr>" ðŸ˜ƒ.
This is of course a great honor and I am very grateful!
I still have to determine what the lecture will be about, but hopefully something about operads and configuration spaces.
Together with my [graduate course on homotopy theory]({{< ref "class/19-20-homotopie" >}}), next semester will be interesting, teaching-wise!
