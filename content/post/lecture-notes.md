This summer I've started to compile lecture notes for my [class](/class/19-20-homotopie) on homotopy theory in January/February.
They are heavily inspired by [Grégory Ginot's lecture notes](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/%7Eginot/Homotopie/Ginot-homotopie2019.pdf) from last year on the same subject, although I've reorganized them a bit; in particular I swapped the last two chapters.
They are still missing the last chapter on $\infty$-categories, and they probably need a lot of polishing -- I am mainly planning to use them as a memory aid during the lectures -- but in case you are interested, they're [available here.](/class/19-20-homotopie/homotopie.pdf)
If you take a look at them, don't hesitate to let me know about any remarks you might have (typos, errors...)
