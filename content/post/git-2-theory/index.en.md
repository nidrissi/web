This post is the second in a series in which I will try to explain how to use Git to write papers, with an audience of professional mathematicians in mind.
[The first part, which was about why one would want to use Git, is here.]({{< ref "git-1-preliminaries" >}})
Let us now dive into the second part, in which I explain a little what's going "under the hood" of Git.

While it is not strictly necessary to know all this to use Git, I think that understanding the mechanics helps in actually using it correctly and efficiently.
Of course, I will not be able to explain _everything_ about Git's inner workings!
