Thursday I'm giving a talk at the online [Toric Topology research seminar](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/research-seminar).
(I was supposed to go there in person, but you can probably expect, the current pandemic made that impossible.)
So I took the opportunity to prepare a little illustration to explain the connection between braids and configuration spaces!

<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
<video controls>
<source src="braid.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
This is supposed to be a video showing a braid and a path in the configuration space, but apparently your browser does not support showing HTML5 videos.
