title: Young Topologists Meeting 2016
---

This week I was at the [Young Topologists Meeting](http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2016/ytm2016/)! It's gotten even bigger than two years ago, as there were more than 180 participants this year. The conference was quite interesting, and Copenhagen is a really nice city! The main theme was homological stability, about which I have learned a lot. The organizers should be applauded, because I can't imagine how hard it must have been to plan a conference this big.

Now that I've done all my (math-related) travelling for the summer, I hope I'll be able to post actual content here...
