Maybe you (I don't know who reads this anyway) haven't noticed, but this blog has a new URL: ~~operad.fr~~ `idrissi.eu`! I splurged and got a domain name. The blog is (for now) still accessible via the old GitHub URL, but this may change at some point... Maybe more details on this later.

*Update:* And now the old Github URL shouldn't work anymore.

*Update 2*: The URL has changed again to `idrissi.eu`.
