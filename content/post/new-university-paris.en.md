It's official: the new University of Paris is born!
For the moment, Paris Diderot University still exists, but it will merge with Paris Descartes and the new university on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020; the IPGP will remain a legally separate entity.
(Yes, it's complicated.)
We have a new logo that you can view on the [university's twitter account](https://twitter.com/Univ_Paris).
We also have [new statutes](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000038252458&dateTexte=20190329) that govern the relatively intricate internal structure of the new university.
A new website [u-paris.fr](http://www.u-paris.fr) was announced with great pomp, but it doesn't work.
And most importantly... all the staff got pots and seeds to plant in them!
Very symbolic.
Hopefully I manage to make it grow correctly.
