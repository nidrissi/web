My paper, ["Formality of a higher codimensional Swiss-Cheese operad"](/research/codim-swiss-cheese), has just been accepted for publication in [_Algebraic & Geometric Topology_](https://msp.org/agt/)!
I am very grateful to the editorial committee for this, as well as to the anonymous referees who provided many suggestions to improve the paper, especially the exposition.
