I finally got the confirmation from the ministry: I got the job and I will be appointed in Paris-VII! A new life is about to begin...

I've been at the Fields Institute (in Toronto) for a week now, to participate in the summer school on derived geometry and higher structures. The lectures and talks are delightful! This whole conference is impressive (especially the abundant food)! Hopefully my own talk tomorrow will not be out of place.

I also learned that some people actually do read my blog! I was a bit surprised. So now I have the moral obligation to flesh out my posts a little. Here's something that I hope people will find interesting.

When I tell people I got the job, they usually ask me where I will be working. This is a bit complicated: French academia is organized in many layers, and it is not easy to extricate what is going on. (A usual way to describing it is a [*mille-feuille*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille-feuille), a typical French dessert that is supposedly made out of a thousands sheets of pastry.) So I will try to describe my own situation, hoping that it can help people trying to navigate French academia better.
