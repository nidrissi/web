title: The Lambrechts–Stanley Model of Configuration Spaces
---

I have uploaded a new preprint, *The Lambrechts–Stanley Model of Configuration Spaces*, which you can find at [arXiv:1608.08054](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08054). Here is the abstract:
<!--more-->

> We prove the validity over $\mathbb{R}$ of a CDGA model of configuration spaces for simply connected manifolds with vanishing Euler characteristic, answering a conjecture of Lambrechts--Stanley. We get as a result that the real homotopy type of such configuration spaces only depends on a Poincaré duality model of the manifold. We moreover prove that our model is compatible with the action of the Fulton--MacPherson operad, by relying on Kontsevich's proof of the formality of the little disks operads. We use this more precise result to get a complex computing factorization homology of manifolds.

I would of course be interested in any comment, question... about this paper.
