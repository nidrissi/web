Today is a holiday, it's raining and cold, and I'm too tired to do anything meaningful.
So I took half an hour to make a picture to go with [my earlier post]({{< ref "/post/next-stop-paris/index.en.md" >}}) about the organizational structure I belong to now.
This picture explains why the signature on [my latest article]({{< ref "/research/codim-swiss-cheese.en.md" >}}) was so long: *Université Paris Diderot, Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche, Sorbonne Paris Cité, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, F-75013 Paris, France.*
