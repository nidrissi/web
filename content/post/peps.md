I applied in January to a call by the math institute (Insmi) of the CNRS, entitled *Projet Exploratoire Premier Soutien « Jeune chercheuse, jeune chercheur »* (PEPS JCJC, roughly *Exploratory Project, First Support: Young Researcher*).
These are small grants (3000--6000 €) for young researchers, in order to allow them to travel and/or invite people, and incite them to apply to larger grants in the followings years, such as the ones from the French ANR, or even the ERC (one can dream).
I just got the answer: it's a yes!
So my project is now funded in 2019, for the amount of 3500 €.
It's comfortable, especially considering that the application and the administrative requirements are lightweight.
Time to get to work!
