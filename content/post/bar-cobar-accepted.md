The paper "[Boardman–Vogt resolutions and bar/cobar constructions of (co)operadic (co)bimodules](/research/bar-cobar)", that Ricardo Campos, Julien Ducoulombier, and I wrote, has been accepted for publication in the journal [*Higher Structures*](https://journals.mq.edu.au/index.php/higher_structures)!
I am of course very grateful to the anonymous referees, who provided very valuable input, and to the editors, for their time spent considering our paper.
