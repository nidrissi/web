title: "New Domain Name"

Maybe you (I don't know who reads this anyway) haven't noticed, but this blog has a new URL: [blog.erad.fr](https://blog.erad.fr)! I splurged and got a domain name. The blog is (for now) still accessible via the old GitHub URL, but this may change at some point... Maybe more details on this later.

*Update:* And now the old Github URL shouldn't work anymore. Hehe.
