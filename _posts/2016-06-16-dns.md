title: "New domain name"

Maybe you (I don't know who reads this anyway) haven't noticed, but this blog has a new URL: [blog.erad.fr](http://blog.erad.fr)! I splurged and got a domain name. The blog is (for now) still accessible via the old GitHub URL, but this may change at some point... Maybe more details on this later.
