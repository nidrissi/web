title: "Configuration Spaces Woes"
tags: math config-spaces
---

I've been neglecting this blog a lot. It turns out that juggling research, teaching, organizing a seminar, and a personal life leaves little time for writing articles!

Most prominently I've been spending a lot of time working on my paper about the Lambrechts--Stanley model for configuration spaces (see [my previous post]({% post_url 2016-08-30-model-conf-spaces %})). The good news is, I'm done (or as done as one can be with a paper), and I've just uploaded the third version of the paper on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08054) (also available [on my lab webpage](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~idrissi/files/model-conf-sp.pdf)) and submitted it. I've finally managed to remove this bothersome hypothesis about the Euler characteristic of the manifold, and I've fixed an issue about my use of the propagator (PA forms are hard).

I've also had the opportunity to give three talks about the paper: at the [annual meeting of the GDR Topologie Alg√©brique](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/1297/) in Amiens, at the [conference in the honor of Said Zarati](http://www.mims.tn/events/details/74) in Tunis, and at the [seminar of the LAGA at Paris 13](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/laga/index.php/fr/ta/seminaires). I'd like to thank the organizers of these events, and especially Sadok Kallel and Bruno Vallette for inviting me at the latter two.

Hopefully I will now have more time to fill this blog! (Or more realistically, do more research.)
