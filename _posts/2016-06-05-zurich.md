Last week I was invited by [Thomas Willwacher](http://user.math.uzh.ch/willwacher/) to ETH Zürich for a few days, during which I also had the opportunity to give a [talk]({{ '/files/center_slides_en.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) at the "Talks in Mathematical Physics" seminar. It was a very interesting few days, and I'm very grateful for this invitation!

It also explains why I've been slacking off a bit with this blog -- my teaching for the year is done and I'm traveling a lot in a short period...
